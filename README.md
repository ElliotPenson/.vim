My Vim Settings

...and lots of colorschemes!

Installing:
----------------------

Fork and then clone this repository, putting the .vim folder in your root directory:

    git clone git://github.com/ElliotPenson/.vim.git

By default, vim will look for the .vimrc configuration file in your root directory. However, one way to get around that is with a symlink. Perform the following to make a .vimrc alias which will point the actual .vimrc file in .vim:

    ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

I use the font Anonymous Pro, which you may also need to download. You can find it here:

Disclaimer:
----------------------
Note that I did not create and do not own any of the colorschemes. I also found the indentation fix [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/200932/how-do-i-make-vim-indent-java-annotations-correctly). Therefore, these files belong to their respective owners.
